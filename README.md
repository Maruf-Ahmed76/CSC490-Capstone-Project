# Senior Capstone Project

This repo was created for the CSC490 Senior Capstone Project at The University of North Carolina Greensboro

## Project Idea:

A tool gives UNCG students the ability to view transferable classes that they can take at an NC Community College in order to save money or take a class that is not available at UNCG.

## Resouces:
- [UNCG Transfer Equivalencies](https://tes.collegesource.com/publicview/TES_publicview01.aspx?rid=200AB5D2-A95C-4895-9836-300D49A73FD1&aid=CFC487EB-2770-451B-8B5D-A20C08DB6323)

- [UNC Online](https://www.gtcc.edu/_files/registration/gtcc_fall_2020_course_schedule.pdf) for online classes at another university

Future Considerations:
- Create a common application to be used at any of the community colleges (apply as visiting student)
